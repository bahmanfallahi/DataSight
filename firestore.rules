/**
 * @file Overview
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user profiles and restricts report deletion to admins only.
 * Data Structure:
 * - User profiles are stored under `/users/{userId}`.
 * - Reports are stored under `/datasight_data/{reportId}` and include the `userId` of the report creator.
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User profiles are accessible only to the owning user.
 * - Report creation and modification are allowed for authenticated users.
 * - Report deletion is restricted to users with the 'admin' role (as determined by custom claims, though backend API is recommended).
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Reports denormalize the `userId` to enable ownership checks without additional reads.
